# GeneLens
**DAA Semester Project**
Based on Distributed Computing, Gene Alignment,Mutation Detection and Disease Prediction

**Project Overview:**
GeneLens is a distributed computing-based project that performs DNA sequence alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm and detects potential mutations by comparing input sequences against a database of genes. It's designed for both local and cloud based clients in order to improve scalability and introduce parallelism.

**Key Features**
1. Distributed architecture design 
2. Local and Cloud clients
3. Smith-Waterman-based genetic alignment
4. Gene comparison for mutation detection
5. Supporting disease prediction

**Technologies used are:**
-> C++ language
-> Socket programming with Winsock2
-> Basic SQL or File handling
-> GitHub CI/CD 
-> Cloud Deployment 

**About Me**
This repository showcases my work for the DAA semester project, where I applied core CS concepts to a real-world problem related to gene and bioinformatics using C++, SQL and socket programming.
